# DTC_Skincare_Analysis

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes 24 months of synthetic sales data for a direct-to-consumer (DTC) skincare brand to identify revenue growth opportunities. Through sales trend analysis and KPI tracking, clear seasonal patterns and high-performing product categories emerged. The analysis highlights opportunities to leverage peak seasonal demand, improve customer retention, and increase customer lifetime value (CLV) through targeted marketing initiatives and subscription offerings.
Key recommendations include capitalizing on strong end-of-year sales momentum, introducing a strategic early summer campaign, and developing subscription models to drive repeat purchases.

1. Leverage end-of-year seasonality: Capitalize on increased November and December demand by including free samples of hero products (exfoliators and serums) to encourage repeat purchases from new customers.
2. Introduce an early summer campaign: Launch a targeted May/June marketing campaign aligned with post–end-of-year purchase frequency. Consider adding SPF samples to orders to promote summer-specific product usage and build seasonal demand.
3. Develop subscription offerings: Create and promote product subscriptions for repeat customers to increase retention and maximize customer lifetime value.

## Business Problem
The objective of this project is to analyze the past 24 months of synthetic sales data for a DTC skincare brand and build an interactive dashboard that surfaces key performance indicators (KPIs). The central business question is:
How can historical sales data be used to identify opportunities for revenue growth and improved customer lifetime value?

## Methodology
1. Generated a large, realistic synthetic dataset using ChatGPT to simulate 24 months of sales activity.
2. Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to track and analyze KPIs, including: Total Revenue, Average Order Value (AOV), Purchase Frequency, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

## Skills Used
AI / ChatGPT: Synthetic data generation

Tableau: Data preparation (ETL), calculated fields, KPI analysis, and data visualization

## Results and Recommendations 
Sales trend analysis revealed strong seasonality, with a significant revenue increase in November and December. Order volume increased by 32% from October to November, indicating heightened end-of-year demand. Exfoliators were the top-performing product category and primary revenue driver, followed by serums.

Based on these findings, the following recommendations are proposed:
1. Leverage end-of-year seasonality: Capitalize on increased November and December demand by including free samples of hero products (exfoliators and serums) to encourage repeat purchases from new customers.
2. Introduce an early summer campaign: Launch a targeted May/June marketing campaign aligned with post–end-of-year purchase frequency. Consider adding SPF samples to orders to promote summer-specific product usage and build seasonal demand.
3. Develop subscription offerings: Create and promote product subscriptions for repeat customers to increase retention and maximize customer lifetime value.

## Next Steps
1. Incorporate marketing performance data to better evaluate campaign effectiveness and calculate return on ad spend (ROAS).
2. Use marketing data to calculate Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and assess the LTV:CAC ratio to further optimize growth strategy.
